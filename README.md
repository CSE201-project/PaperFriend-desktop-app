# PaperFriend  
A smart journaling desktop application to help you track your mood and take better care of your mental health.  

It starts with a journalling app. Everyday, the user can write entries to their journal to put on paper their thoughts or feelings. He/She can also click on some activities (like playing sports, studying etc) to add them to their daily entry. Likewise, they can add the people they spent time with. The user is then asked to evaluate their mood/day with a slider (from worst to best day of their life). It is then possible for them to see the evolution of their mood in time.
This is for the regular journaling part.  

The specificity of the project is that the data that the user creates by writing the journal is analysed to find trends or patterns in their mood and give them some insights about them. For example, if during the last 10 consecutive days the mood of the user was lower than usual, it might indicate that something's going wrong and the app will be able to notify the user about this. Likewise, if it continues for an extended period of time, the app can advise him to talk with a professional and provide the phone number of a nearby psychologist. It can also warn them if their mood is on a downward trend and if they saw nobody during the past few days: it may be a clue that it's time to go out and engage with friends.    
The trends and patterns that it analyses can be numerous. For example, the app will be able to tell to the user that every first Tuesday of the mont month they are experiencing a spike of stress. With this information, the user will then be able to figure out what is going wrong and causes them this stress.   
The app can even find correlations between the mood/emotions of the user and the activities and social interactions they had during the day. For example, the app may notice that when the user is playing a sport, their daily mood is 30% higher than the average. Another example could be that the user has a toxic relationship with one of their relatives and experiences a spike of stress or a drop in mood the days he spent with that person.  

Thus PaperFriend helps you introspect to understand what makes you happy, stressed or depressed and keeps an eye on your mood and mental health.


As an extension, if we have the time, Paper Friend can even help you with other aspects of your life. For example, we wish to implement a habit tracker in the app. The user could tell the app that they want to go to the gym every monday and the app would ask them if they did so every monday. We plan to add a gamified experience to help the user stick to this new habit.  
We could also sync the app with the google account to display the user's calendar or his google tasks: PaerFriend is a hub to organize your life.

Based on the same model we can also adapt the personal journal to a project-oriented journal. The user would not track their mood anymore but rather their performance or the advancement of their project.
