| Thomas Turkieh       |File processing|- Finished the functions to save/load the available activities/friends.<br> - I had an unfortunate issue : after pulling the main branch, the project was building infinitely, and it took me a few hours to find and understand the problem, which fortunately was not hard to fix in the end.<br>- Enjoyed this issue to come back on the file arborescence and modify it, now every file is organized in a corresponding folder.   |- Implement saving and loading functions for the Entry recap objects. Maybe also enhance them.  |
