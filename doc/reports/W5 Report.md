| Octave Gaspard       |Data analysis  |- Organization of the data analysis team <br>- Setting up the integration of data analysis with other teams <br>- Rewrote old parts of the code to make them work better, like find_index_sorted. <br>- Fully finished the STL decomposition algorithm with the full inner loop and outer loop.<br>- Debugged all sub-functions and tested that STL gave correct-looking results, chose temporary constants according to [the research paper](https://www.scb.se/contentassets/ca21efb41fee47d293bbee5bf7be7fb3/stl-a-seasonal-trend-decomposition-procedure-based-on-loess.pdf). <br>|- Finish with the rest of the team the integration of the analysis in the app. <br>- Test and choose better constants for the application we do of STL. <br>- Replace or improve other analysis functions by using values given by STL. <br>- Optimize the code.<br>|
