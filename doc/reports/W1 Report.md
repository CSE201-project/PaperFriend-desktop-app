| Thomas Turkieh       |File processing    |-discussion with the analysis team to stay coherent between the saving and analysis of the data.<br> - did a lot of research to understand the structure and how to create a C++ library but also how to test the functions (I opted for the QT framework for the tests) <br> - did research to understand and choose what type of encoding we'll use for our data (I opted for a 64 bit basic encodig with a key).<br> - Implemented the encoding functions and I started to implement the functions to treat our data and save it, (trying to use templates to be able to save any type of entry class). |- Finish the implementation and run some tests to verify that the whole code works<br> - also extend the code to not only the Entry class but to its child classes Entryperso (already started on this with templates). <br> -Write the wiki for the use of those functions|

| Octave Gaspard       |Data analysis      |- Discussed with the File processing team the best way to represent saved user data.<br>- Found what analysis we could do on the user data with the Data analysis team.<br>- Implemented basic function template average_vector and wrote the [wiki](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki) page for the [DayLog](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/Day-Log) class.<br>| - Decide with the team who will do which part of the analysis and start working on them.  |
