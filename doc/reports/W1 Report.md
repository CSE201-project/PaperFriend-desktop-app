| Romain Puech         |Frontend (specific)|- Conceived project structure, teams and detailed tasks.<br>-Wrote project description and roadmap<br>-Drew UI examples<br>-Wrote the [wiki](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki) pages related to graphics, entries and UI to explain project structure<br>-Implemented the class [DynamicGraph](https://github.com/orgs/CSE201-project/projects/4/views/2?filterQuery=assignee%3A%40me) using Qt Charts|- Review W1 code<br>- Continue to implment DynamicGraph class: make it more beautiful and working with entries' dates<br>-Define new tasks and answer questions/organise |
| Bogdana Kolic        |Frontend (specific)|     -Implemented the [Card](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/17) class and updated its [wiki page](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/Card-class) <br> -Started working on the [EntryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/9) class and implemented the display of the "entry date" and "mood".<br>   |   -Continue working on the [EntryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/EntryCard-class)  class.<br>|

| Yubo Cai             |Frontend (specific)|     This week my task was to work very independently with other members and I completed the implementation of the [TextEditor](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/tree/main/TextEditor). I complete the Design of the UI for the TextEditor and backend function of it. I created two class of `TextEditor` and `Edit` in the program. Now the TextEditor applicaiton can compile successfully and able to achieve the basic functions like edit, change color and font, copy, paste and so on.   |  Next week, as I planed, I will continue to improve the **TextEditor** with more operation like left-justify and right-justify, undo and redo. Also corrent some bugs in the program and build API for the data anlysis team so that they can get data for analysis.  |

| Safaa Arbai          |Frontend (general) |- Looked for some of the classes needed to implement a user interface.<br>-Wrote the wiki [Classes needed for UI](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/Classes-needed-for-UI) page with the classes, a short description and link for more information on them. <br>- I fixed the main window's layout so that the frames would resize according to the window's size. <br>- Followed a youtube Qt C++ GUI tutorial to understand more how Qt designer works.|-I'll work on impementing a button that opens a new window in addition to the close, restore down and minimize buttons.<br> - I'll also discuss with the general front end team what we need to put in our menu bar and work on implementing it. |

| Thomas Turkieh       |File processing    |-discussion with the analysis team to stay coherent between the saving and analysis of the data.<br> - did a lot of research to understand the structure and how to create a C++ library but also how to test the functions (I opted for the QT framework for the tests) <br> - did research to understand and choose what type of encoding we'll use for our data (I opted for a 64 bit basic encodig with a key).<br> - Implemented the encoding functions and I started to implement the functions to treat our data and save it, (trying to use templates to be able to save any type of entry class). |- Finish the implementation and run some tests to verify that the whole code works<br> - also extend the code to not only the Entry class but to its child classes Entryperso (already started on this with templates). <br> -Write the wiki for the use of those functions|
| Junyuan (Frank) Wang |File processing    |     -Include an AES cipher class which is compatible with QT project. <br> - Implement string to string encryption and decryption cipher function. <br> - Add wiki page.    |   -Continue on the cipher function. Implement it with saving functions and `Entry` Class. <br> - start working on the selection method for `Entry` class files. |

| Octave Gaspard       |Data analysis      |- Discussed with the File processing team the best way to represent saved user data.<br>- Found what analysis we could do on the user data with the Data analysis team.<br>- Implemented basic function template average_vector and wrote the [wiki](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki) page for the [DayLog](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/Day-Log) class.<br>| - Decide with the team who will do which part of the analysis and start working on them.  |
| Brook Nigatu         |Data analysis      |- Created the classes DataAnalysis and MoodAnalysis to give structure to what will be done in the coming weeks and a [wiki page](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/wiki/Data-Analysis) dedicated to DataAnalysis. <br> - Wrote a simple method "alert_depression" (not functional yet as it uses another unimplemented method).| - Brainstorm some ideas with the team on the details of how the data will be analyzed and start implementing them.|
