| Bogdana Kolic        |Frontend (general)|- I [integrated the TextEditor into the EntryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/48) and [made the difference](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/57) between the readOnly and Editing mode<br>- I also implemented the buttons for switching the modes and saving the updates in the entry<br>- I used the `save_entryperso()` function to [save the updates into a file](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/49)<br>- I added a [mood_slider](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/56) so that the user can add their mood into the entry<br>- I modified the display of friends and activities to represent the actual list of friends and activities from the entry (EntryPerso) <br>|-I still have to make it possible for the user to [modify activities and friends](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/52)<br>|

| Thomas Turkieh       |File processing    |- Implemented functions to save and load an "EntryPerso" object in JSON file. Adapted the format of the file for that and designed algorithms to store automatically several objects like activities or friends which are themselves attributes of "EntryPerso" object. (used a string format for this).<br> - changed the implementation of the EntryPerso object to store its attributes Activities and Friends in vectors of pointers instead of simple arrays (so it's more practical for everyone).||

| Brook Nigatu         |Data analysis      |- Changed the way we parametrize variables to be analyzed so that both predefined and user-defined activities and parameters can be considered in the analysis. <br> - Modified all methods in data analysis class to work with this new system <br>|- Discuss more ways of analyzing data with the team and implement them|
