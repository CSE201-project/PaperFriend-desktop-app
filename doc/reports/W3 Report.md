|:----------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------------|:------------------|
| Romain Puech         |Frontend (specific)|- [Use entries'dates](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/54) as x-axis for DynamicGraph<br>- [Style modifications](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/53) to DynamicGraph <br>- Created [MascotChat](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/55) class and implemented all basic functionalities of the class. Changed UI accordingly to display the messages in a scrollable area <br>- Implemented [scrollable area](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/21) in the main window to be able to display many entries on the screen, one below the other<br>- fixed various compilation problems <br>- Organised new [tasks](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/64) ||
| Bogdana Kolic        |Frontend (general)|||
| Liam Loughman        |Frontend (specific)|||
| Yubo Cai             |Frontend (general)| - Clean some unnesseary function in TextEditor and fixed some bugs and add more functions of it. <br> - Work with Bogdana with on put `TextEditor` class in to the `EntryCard`. <br> - Work with Bogdana on the `EntryCard` class for writing/display mode distinction of the TextEditor||
| Luigi Massacci       |Frontend (general) |||
| Safaa Arbai          |Frontend (specific) |||
| Ahmed Benchekroun    |Frontend (specific) |||
| Mihaela Gledacheva   |Frontend (general) | - Implemented functions to read the settings from a file <br> - Changed the main window to display n (randomly generated for now) entries and the mood graph corresponding to them <br> - Added option for the user to create a new entry | - Continue synchronizing different components |
| Thomas Turkieh       |File processing    |- Implemented functions to save and load an "EntryPerso" object in JSON file. Adapted the format of the file for that and designed algorithms to store automatically several objects like activities or friends which are themselves attributes of "EntryPerso" object. (used a string format for this).<br> - changed the implementation of the EntryPerso object to store its attributes Activities and Friends in vectors of pointers instead of simple arrays (so it's more practical for everyone).||
| Junyuan (Frank) Wang |File processing    | - Implement a function to filter a vector of Entry objects. It takes a vector of entries as input and a function and output a vector of pointers of entries. <br> - Implement a function to check whether the entry satisfy the function with numerical attributes. <br> - Change the main GUI for a new widget for filter the vectors showing on the screen. <br> - Create a filter_widget class for signals in GUI| - Finish to implement the signals of the filter widget. <br> - implement the display of the filtered entries on the main window.|
| Octave Gaspard       |Data analysis      |- Organization of the analysis subteam; we discussed with the rest of the team to find how to change the activities handling inside error class. <br> - Understand the [research paper](https://www.scb.se/contentassets/ca21efb41fee47d293bbee5bf7be7fb3/stl-a-seasonal-trend-decomposition-procedure-based-on-loess.pdf) and the properties of STL : robustness to unusual user behaviour, ability to have control over some parameters of the seasonality component, ability to decompose even with missing data. <br> - Start the implementation of STL with the loess protocol. <br> - Research on how to solve weighted least squares quadratic regression in our case.|- Continue working on the STL decomposition. <br> - Work with the rest of the team to test and integrate our analysis on the app prototype.|
| Brook Nigatu         |Data analysis      |- Changed the way we parametrize variables to be analyzed so that both predefined and user-defined activities and parameters can be considered in the analysis. <br> - Modified all methods in data analysis class to work with this new system <br>|- Discuss more ways of analyzing data with the team and implement them|
