| Octave Gaspard       |Data analysis      |- Organization of the analysis team <br>- Common work with the subteam to find new ways of studying the user's data that can give useful insights <br>- Added time-related functionalities in the Entry class (get info on the day of the week/distance between two days) <br>- Switched time representation in the Entry class to QDate, with retrocompatibility (old methods still work) <br>- Research about time series analysis to understand the change in a user's data over time (trend-cycle component vs seasonality component).|- Work on the implementation of the STL algorithm (the method is described in [this paper](https://www.scb.se/contentassets/ca21efb41fee47d293bbee5bf7be7fb3/stl-a-seasonal-trend-decomposition-procedure-based-on-loess.pdf))|
| Brook Nigatu         |Data analysis      |- Refactored most of mood-specific analysis functions (in the class MoodAnalysis) into DataAnalysis to avoid writing them over and over for other variables. To do so, I implemented a representation of the variables using an enum type to enable parametrization of the different variables in our methods, along with other methods that retrieve data specific to a variable using this parametrization.<br>- Implemented an algorithm to compute linear regression coefficients to help identify trends in the data to be analyzed.|- Figure out with the rest of the team on how exactly to use the algorithms implemented so far to analyze user-data and proceed accoringly. <br>- Testing what we have so far|
