|:----------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------------|:------------------|
| Romain Puech         |Frontend (specific)|||
| Bogdana Kolic        |Frontend (specific)|-Reimplemented Card and EntryCard classes to work with layouts <br>-Modified their display so that the cards are resizable (and as a consequence don't have rounded corners) and changed the style a bit <br>-Added a display of "friends and activities" , entry title and text in [EntryCard](https://github.com/CSE201-project/PaperFriend-desktop-app/issues/9))<br>||

| Safaa Arbai          |Frontend (general) |||
| Ahmed Benchekroun    |Frontend (general) |||
| Mihaela Gledacheva   |Frontend (general) | - Corrected some mistakes in the entry classes <br> - Wrote a wiki for all the classes implemented by me during W1 <br> - Created an initial version of the settings menu||
| Thomas Turkieh       |File processing    |||
| Junyuan (Frank) Wang |File processing    |- Decide to use json file to save the entry into local files. <br> - Implement saving fuction with encryption and loading function with decryption on the base of Thomas's work. <br>|- Implement select_n_entries function which select several entries from local disk.|
| Octave Gaspard       |Data analysis      |- Organization of the analysis team <br>- Common work with the subteam to find new ways of studying the user's data that can give useful insights <br>- Added time-related functionalities in the Entry class (get info on the day of the week/distance between two days) <br>- Switched time representation in the Entry class to QDate, with retrocompatibility (old methods still work) <br>- Research about time series analysis to understand the change in a user's data over time (trend-cycle component vs seasonality component).|- Work on the implementation of the STL algorithm (the method is described in [this paper](https://www.scb.se/contentassets/ca21efb41fee47d293bbee5bf7be7fb3/stl-a-seasonal-trend-decomposition-procedure-based-on-loess.pdf))|
| Brook Nigatu         |Data analysis      |- Refactored most of mood-specific analysis functions (in the class MoodAnalysis) into DataAnalysis to avoid writing them over and over for other variables. To do so, I implemented a representation of the variables using an enum type to enable parametrization of the different variables in our methods, along with other methods that retrieve data specific to a variable using this parametrization.<br>- Implemented an algorithm to compute linear regression coefficients to help identify trends in the data to be analyzed.|- Figure out with the rest of the team on how exactly to use the algorithms implemented so far to analyze user-data and proceed accoringly. <br>- Testing what we have so far|
