| Octave Gaspard       |Data analysis      |- Organization of the analysis team <br>- Common work with the subteam to find new ways of studying the user's data that can give useful insights <br>- Added time-related functionalities in the Entry class (get info on the day of the week/distance between two days) <br>- Switched time representation in the Entry class to QDate, with retrocompatibility (old methods still work) <br>- Research about time series analysis to understand the change in a user's data over time (trend-cycle component vs seasonality component).|- Work on the implementation of the STL algorithm (the method is described in [this paper](https://www.scb.se/contentassets/ca21efb41fee47d293bbee5bf7be7fb3/stl-a-seasonal-trend-decomposition-procedure-based-on-loess.pdf))|
